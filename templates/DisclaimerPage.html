<p> This Privacy Notice explains how this website process information about the visitors. </p>
<h4>1. Who’s Who and What This Privacy Notice Covers</h4>
<p>Our website, www.kizillab.org and its data repository sites are non-commercial, educational websites that informs the public about our academics endeavors. This website complies with the GDPR requirements. Details will be given below. We put together this Privacy Notice to help our visitors understand the information we collect, how that information is used and disclosed. Please see the <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy </a>of the website hosting to access the larger information on data privacy.</p>
<h4>2. Information We Collect About Visitors to Our Users’ Sites</h4>
<p>We collect information about visitors to our website in a few different ways. </p>
<h4>Information a Visitor Provides to a Site</h4>
<p>We’ll start with information that visitors provide directly to the site, which primarily happens when visitors type into a text field, like a comment field or a sign-up form.</p>
<p>Here are the most common ways in which a visitor directly provides information to a site:</p>
<li>Follower and Subscriber Information: When a visitor signs up to follow or subscribe to a site, we collect the sign-up information requested by the site, which typically includes an email address.</li>
<li>Site Comments: When a visitor leaves a comment on a site, we collect that comment, and other information that the visitor provides along with the comment, such as the visitor’s name and email address.</li>
<li>Crowdsignal Survey Responses: When a visitor completes a poll, quiz, or other type of survey prepared by a user, we collect the visitor’s responses to those surveys, and other information that the survey owner requires for a poll/quiz/survey response, like an e-mail address.</li>
<li>Other Information Entered on the Site: We may also collect other information that a visitor enters on the site–such as a contact form submission, a search query, or site registration.</li>
<p>Information We Automatically Collect from the Site</p>
<p>We also automatically collect some information about visitors to the site. The information we automatically collect depends on which of our services the site uses. We’ve listed examples below:</p>
<li>Technical Data from a Visitor’s Computer and Etcetera: We collect the information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available about visitors to a site, such as the IP address, browser type, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.</li>
<li>Visitor Interactions: We collect information about a visitor’s interactions with a Site, including the “<a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/likes/">likes</a>“ and “<a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/ratings/">ratings</a>" left by visitors to the site.</li>
<li>Location Information: We may determine the approximate location of a visitor’s device from the IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, tally for our visitors how many people visit the site from certain geographic regions. If you’d like, you can read more about the <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/stats/"> Site Stats </a> feature for WordPress.com sites and Jetpack sites.</li>
<li>Jetpack Site Activity: We collect visitor activities related to the management of the site, such as login attempts/actions and comment submission and management actions. For more information, please see the <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/privacy/">Jetpack Privacy Center.</a></li>
<li>Information from Cookies and Other Technologies: A cookie is a string of information that a site stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the site each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on Sites. Some hosting sites use cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help identify and track visitors and Site usage, and to deliver targeted ads when ads are enabled for free WordPress.com sites or when ads are enabled on a Site through WordAds or Jetpack Ads (see the “Other Tools" section below for more details). For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how visitors can control the use of cookies, please see our <a href="https://automattic.com/cookies/">Cookie Policy.</a></li>
<h4>3. How We Use Visitor Information</h4>
<p>Wordpress.com uses information about site visitors in order to provide service to users and their sites. Users may use these services to, for example, create and manage their site, flag and fight comments from spammers, and collect information through polls, quizzes and other surveys. kizillab.org is a non-commercial, non-profit website and does not engage in any commercial activity.</p>
<h4>4. How Visitor Information May Be Shared</h4>
<p>Kizillab.org does not share any collected information. Wordpress.org has a policy as explained below in boxes:</p>
<li>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose Site visitor information to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our services to our Users and their Sites, or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Notice for information about visitors that we share with them. </li>
<li>Legal Requests: We may disclose Site visitor information in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information, please see our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/legal-guidelines/"> Legal Guidelines. </a></li>
<li>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others: We may disclose Site visitor information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, our Users, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay. </li>
<li>Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, Site visitor information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Notice would continue to apply to Site visitor information and the party receiving this information may continue to use this information, but only consistent with this Privacy Notice. </li>
<li>Information Shared Publicly: Information that visitors choose to make public is–you guessed it–disclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like visitor comments and “likes" are all available to others, including information about the visitor that is displayed in connection with a comment or “like" (such as a visitor’s WordPress.com username and Gravatar). We provide a “firehose" stream of public data (including comments) from Sites to provide that data to firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content, but do not have rights to re-publish it publicly. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. </li>
<h4>5. Other Tools</h4>
<p>Ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about visitors’ use of a Site and across other websites and online services, such as a visitor’s IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by those companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to visitor interests. For more information about how to manage and delete cookies, visit aboutcookies.org, and for more information on interest-based ads, including information about how visitors may be able to opt out of having their web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">aboutads.info/choices</a> (US based) and youronlinechoices.eu (EU based).</p>
<h4>6. Other Resources</h4>
<p><a href="http://privacy.blog/">privacy.blog</a> for more information about privacy and transparency at Automattic / Wordpress.com that hosts this website.</p>
<p><a href="https://automattic.com/cookies/">Cookie Policy</a>: Please read this for cookie policies pertaining to this website.</p>
<h4>7. How can Visitors Access/Delete their Data</h4>
<p>If you have any concerns or questions on the storage of the data, please contact us using the web-contact form <a href="https://kizillab.org/contact/">HERE</a>. Please also see our <a href="https://kizillab.org/impressum/">Impressum.</a></p>
<h4>8. Cookie Information</h4>
<p>All visitors are asked to decide on whether they accept or not the cookie policy. This comes with a banner when you visit the site. This is called a Cookie Widget.</p>
<h4>The Cookie Widget</h4>
<p>Sites hosted on WordPress.com make use of cookies for a variety of different purposes. Some cookies are only set for registered WordPress.com users, whereas others are set for all visitors. We aim to collect the minimal amount of data necessary to provide our services. For more detailed information, see our dedicated <a href="https://automattic.com/cookies/">Cookie Policy page </a>and <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<li>Hiding the banner – The banner can be set to be dismissed in one of three ways: when a visitor specifically clicks the button, when a visitor scrolls, or after a specific time. The minimum length of time is 3 seconds, and the maximum 1000. Once the banner is hidden, a technical cookie named eucookielawis set, which prevents it from being displayed to the same user again for 30 days.
For members of the <a href="https://wordads.co/">WordAds program</a>, EU visitors must click the “Close and accept" button in order for their ads to be personalized on your site. Such ads return a higher revenue rate to be shared with you. Keep this in mind when deciding how to hide the banner. </li>
<li>Banner text– The banner will display a default cookie notification message, which can be customized if required. </li>
<li>Policy URL – By default this creates a link to the <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/cookies/">WordPress.com cookies policy</a>. Should you wish to link to your own policy, you can do so by adding a <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/pages/new-page-screen/">page </a>to your site, and inserting the link in the field below “Custom:". After inserting the link you will be able to select the custom option. </li>
<p>In addition to the widget, you can also visit the link: <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/cookies/"> WordPress.com cookies policy</a>.</p>
